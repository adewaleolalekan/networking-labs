# Welcome to Lab 2: TCP/IP Protocols and Port Management! 🌐

In this lab, you'll master the transport layer protocols that power all network communication - including Kubernetes.

## What You'll Learn

- **TCP vs UDP**: Understand when to use each protocol
- **Port Management**: Learn how applications use ports to communicate
- **Service Detection**: Identify what services are running on which ports
- **Network Analysis**: Use tools like netcat, netstat, and ss
- **Kubernetes Application**: See how Services use ports and protocols

## Why This Matters for Kubernetes

Every Kubernetes Service exposes applications on specific ports using TCP or UDP. Understanding these protocols helps you:
- Configure Services correctly
- Troubleshoot connectivity issues
- Secure your applications
- Design efficient microservices

## Prerequisites

- Completed Lab 1 (CIDR and subnetting) - recommended but not required
- Basic Linux command line knowledge
- Familiarity with client-server concepts

## Tools You'll Use

This lab includes:
- `netcat` (nc) - Network Swiss Army knife
- `netstat` - Network statistics
- `ss` - Socket statistics (modern netstat replacement)
- `curl` - Transfer data from/to servers
- `lsof` - List open files and network connections

## Lab Format

Each step includes:
1. Conceptual explanation
2. Hands-on exercises
3. Automatic verification
4. Real-world Kubernetes examples

## Tips for Success

- Run all commands exactly as shown
- Read error messages carefully
- Use the tools to explore - experiment!
- Think about how each concept applies to containers

**Estimated time:** 60-75 minutes
