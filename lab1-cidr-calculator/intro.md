# Welcome to CIDR Calculator Practice! 🌐

### Developed by Adewale Olalekan

In this lab, you'll master IP subnetting and CIDR notation - essential skills for networking and Kubernetes.

## What You'll Learn

- How to read and understand CIDR notation (like `/24`, `/16`)
- Calculate network addresses, broadcast addresses, and usable host ranges
- Determine how many devices can fit in a subnet
- Apply these concepts to Kubernetes pod networking

## Tools Available

This lab environment includes:
- `ipcalc` - A subnet calculator tool
- `sipcalc` - Another subnet calculator with different output format
- Standard Linux networking tools

## Lab Format

Each step will:
1. Present a CIDR block to analyze
2. Ask you to calculate specific values
3. Save your answers to a file
4. Automatically verify your work

## Tips for Success

- Use `ipcalc <CIDR>` to check your work
- Remember: usable hosts = total addresses - 2 (network + broadcast)
- The `/X` in CIDR tells you how many bits are used for the network
